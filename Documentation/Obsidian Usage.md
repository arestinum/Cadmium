I'm using this application as I've taken a liking to it a lot and seek to use this across projects and practice the skill with it. There may be a lot of changes throughout, like to the structure of the vault and the configuration of it. I seek to find a system that works best for me, where it is also simple, extensive and easy to input into.

# Folder Structure

## Vault Configuration
The `Vault Configuration` folder is intended to configure this Obsidian vault. I have this to handle the community plugins stuff that you could use if you'd like.

## Cadmium
The folder containing the details pertaining to the Cadmium project.
