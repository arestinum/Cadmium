Welcome to Cadmium's documentation space.

I am using the note-taking application: Obsidian here with various community plugins. This vault is experimental, as a way to practice project management, documentation and active thinking.

If you'd like to see information how I am using this through Obsidian, you may visit: [[Obsidian Usage]].

Here you can expect thoughts and formal documentations (my attempt at them at least). They can be incoherent and difficult to follow.
